My balcony is full of (green) plants, which makes the balcony less hot. Ventilation and wind give cooling, as do good curtains and heat-resistant film. A fan that gives cooling. Sit outside on the quay in the wind and under the trees in front of the door.<br><br>If it's cold, put on thick jumpers, thick socks, and slippers. Again, that lack of insulation makes it cold in the house quickly. The basement is nice and warm now. Stove on, but only in the room, no CV (yet). IR panels to heat the rest. With a winter duvet, nice and warm. - Hans"

At the quay, it is usually windy, and the big tree there provides some shade.<br><br>With a folding chair, drinks, and a good book, it's good to relax there. Usually, a familiar person also always comes along with me. Just saying hello is then nice and sufficient. - Ellen"
